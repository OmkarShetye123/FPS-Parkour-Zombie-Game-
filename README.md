# FPS-Parkour-Zombie-Game-# 🔫 FPS Parkour Zombie Game (Unity)

A **first-person shooter + parkour survival game** built entirely from scratch in **Unity**, featuring fast-paced movement, environmental hazards, and aggressive zombie enemies. The game blends **FPS combat**, **precision parkour**, and **maze-based level design** to progressively increase difficulty across **five challenging levels**.

## 🎮 Game Concept

This game challenges the player to **survive, navigate, and fight** through dangerous environments where:

* Zombies actively hunt and attack the player
* Moving platforms test timing and parkour skills
* Deadly moving balls instantly kill on contact
* Maze-like levels increase tension and difficulty

Each level introduces new threats and tighter spaces, forcing players to balance **movement, aim, and decision-making**.
